# !! This repository is for backup purposes only, instead of using my modification I recommend using the Vulcaman version.

## This is not my original project so all credits goes to Vulcaman "https://www.instructables.com/DIY-REFLOW-OVEN/" and to polihedron "https://github.com/polihedron/DIY-Reflow-Oven"

## What did I change.
### 1. I made a 3D Design of a faceplate with fan for my oven "SEVERIN Mini Four 9L".
### 2. Added Attiny85 for controlling "Cooling Fan" when the Reflow cycle ends the fan starts until you press Stop.
### 3. Increased temperature range in "blue pill" and in "Nexion display grapf" up to 250C.
