# !! This repository is for backup purposes only, instead of using my modification I recommend using the Vulcaman version.

## This is not my original project so all credits goes to 
* Vulcaman "https://www.instructables.com/DIY-REFLOW-OVEN/" 
* polihedron "https://github.com/polihedron/DIY-Reflow-Oven"

### What did I change.
* I made a 3D Design of a faceplate with fan for my oven "SEVERIN Mini Four 9L".
* Added Attiny85 for controlling "Cooling Fan" when the Reflow cycle ends the fan starts until you press Stop.
* Increased temperature range in "blue pill" and in "Nexion display File" up to 250C.
